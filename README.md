# Heart-Disease-Detection

## Intro
Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) and heart defects (congenital heart defects), among others. Heart disease is one of the biggest cause for morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subject in the section of clinical data analysis. Number of researches are devoted to develop and examine suitable recognition systems. The core component of such systems utilized classification technique, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and logistic regression. 

In this project, we investigated the effectiveness of the logistic regression classifier in heart disease detection.

## Dataset 
The dataset used in this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset taken from the UCI repository. The
dataset consists of 303 instances. There are 14 columns representing the features and the label in the
dataset (CSV file).
